# Etherscan-Assigment
We used C# (Dot net core 2.1) and Selenium 4 for automation.
For Successful test execution CAPCTHA should be disabled.
Log file will be generated at C:\temp
Intigrate this code in TFS Repository and set up CI CD pip line. TFS reports will be useful.
As of now I have automated the for 3 Browsers i.e. EdgeChromium, Chrome and Mozilla firefox. You can change Url,Browser(chrome,firefox,edgechromium) value for Appconfig.json or You can put placeholder in Appconfig file and create release template and veriables in TFS so that you can change values from tfs
You can set only one browser value in appconfig.json file.
I have added also manual Test scenarios with this project.
